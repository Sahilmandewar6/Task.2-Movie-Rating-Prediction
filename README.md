# Task.2-Movie-Rating-Prediction

Movie Rating Prediction
Overview:
The Movie Rating Prediction project is an exploration into the world of machine learning and predictive analytics, aiming to forecast movie ratings based on various features. Leveraging a dataset containing information about movies, genres, cast, and other relevant factors, this project employs machine learning algorithms to predict the likely ratings that users might assign to movies.

Features:
Data Exploration: Dive into a rich dataset that encapsulates a diverse range of movies, genres, and user ratings. Uncover patterns, trends, and correlations within the data.

Data Preprocessing: Cleanse and prepare the dataset for analysis, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and ensuring data quality.

Machine Learning Model: Develop a predictive model using machine learning algorithms to forecast movie ratings. Train the model on historical data to make accurate predictions for new movies.

Evaluation Metrics: Assess the performance of the machine learning model using relevant evaluation metrics, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), to gauge the accuracy of predictions.

Interactive Dashboard: Utilize visualization tools, such as Power BI, to create an interactive dashboard showcasing key insights, movie statistics, and predictions.

Technologies Used:
Python for data preprocessing and machine learning model development.
Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis and model training.
Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn for data manipulation and machine learning.
Power BI for creating interactive and insightful dashboards.
GitHub for version control and collaboration.
